This summer we have been working on coding a NAO robot in `python` to perform three different autonomous tasks:

* Design of winning strategies to different games.
* Design on human-like behavior motion planning for obstacle avoidance.
* Vision recognition applied to music sheets to identify and play songs.

These three tasks are a clear exponent on how basic mathematics help achieve very complex feats in artificial intelligence.  The design of strategies to win at games is done by generalizing root-finding techniques in Calculus.  The analysis of the different strategies is performed with techniques of statistics.  Motion planning is carried within the field of computational geometry, and the design of smooth paths is merely an application of interpolation techniques.  Finally, the project related to vision recognition is done under the scope of image processing, which is in turn a set of basic applications of multivariate Calculus.
